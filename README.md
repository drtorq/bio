# Dr. Torq bio

My name is Rob Reilly and I'm widely known an "Dr. Torq". 

I help people understand the latest cutting-edge tech.



With a background in engineering, fabrication and information technology, I'm uniquely able to explain physical computing, hardware hacking, Linux/OSS, the tech media, and the DIY/Maker movement to just about anybody. The steampunk aesthetic is awesome and I think it's a perfect metaphor for promoting STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math).

Developing, designing and building physical projects, then writing and speaking about them are my stock in trade. 

I've written hundreds of in-depth "how-to" articles covering cutting-edge technology, microcontrollers, desktop/command-line applications
mobile/portable computing, physical computing, IoT, hacking and Linux. Not only that, the steampunk projects I build regularly use an Arduino, Raspberry Pi or some other electro/electronic/mechanical device in a fun or practical way. I'm certainly a Linux guy.

Most recently, I've focused on using FreeCad, on a late-model higher-end Dell notebook (running Xubuntu) to design parts 
for output to a Prusa MK3S printer. 3D printed parts take my projects to the next level with interesting enclosures, exposed gearboxes and 
unusual mechanisms, along with all manner of mundane utilitarian links, bushings, adapters and brackets. 

I've also presented projects and given tech talks at various industry conferences including OSCON, the Future of Education Technology 
Conference (FETC), the Embedded Systems Conference and others. 

I'm available for consulting and would love to give a talk at your event.
