# Dr. Torq bio

My name is Rob Reilly and I'm widely known an "Dr. Torq". 

As an independent consultant, writer, and speaker specialize in helping people understand physical computing, hardware hacking, Linux/OSS, the tech media, and the DIY/Maker movement. I love the steampunk aesthetic and think it's a perfect metaphor for promoting interest in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math).

Developing, designing and building physical projects, then writing and speaking about them are my stock in trade.

I've written hundreds of in-depth "how-to" articles covering cutting-edge technology, microcontrollers, desktop/command-line applications
mobile/portable computing, physical computing, IoT, hacking and Linux. My steampunk-inspired projects regularly contain an Arduino, 
Raspberry Pi or some other electro/electronic/mechanical device. I'm pretty a Linux guy.

Most recently, I've focused on using FreeCad, on a late-model higher-end Dell notebook (running Xubuntu) to design parts 
for output a Prusa MK3S printer. 3D printed parts take my projects to the next level with interesting enclosures, exposed gearboxes and 
unusual mechanisms, along with all manner of mundane utilitarian links, bushings, adapters and brackets. 

I've also presented projects and given tech talks at various industry conferences including OSCON, the Future of Education Technology 
Conference (FETC), the Embedded Systems Conference and others. 

I'm available for consulting and would love to give a talk at your event.
